The client_stream_size stays constant\n   at 8K, and the new 'buffer' size is 4K\n   Note also that the new code uses the \"default\" socket buffer size\n   it obtains with the first accept()ed socket.\n * use setjmp, instead of sigsetjmp (we dont mess with the signal mask\n   so why bother!  it's one less syscall)\n * explicitly set pending_requests to 0 in select.c when sigterm_flag has\n   been set, and also when the server socket is *not* set despite checking\n   for it.\n * make default behavior be to leave stderr alone, but tie it\n   to cgilog otherwise\n * add initial vhost_root support\n * remove support for normalize_path\n * use --disable-sendfile to disable sendfile support\n   sendfile support for files &gt; 100K is default, now.\n   It's significantly faster and easier than the alternative\n * add \"Host\" header support to CGI environment\n * umask ~0770 before exec\n * backport hash.c from 0.95 and use fnv1a hash (see CREDITS)\n * don't set stderr close-on-exec\n * make some minor for very useful optimizations in the read/write\n   loop for CGIs\n * make some adjustments for Solaris and other platforms\n * add yyerror function definition to boa_lexer.l\n * tie stdout to the access_log, unless there is no access_log,\n   in which case tie it to /dev/null\n * use sensible defaults for umask (077) and (027 for CGI)\n * add and document new parameters (CGILog and CGIumask)\n * vast improvements to the cgi-test.cgi program, by Jon Nelson\n   and Landon Curt Noll.\n * next 3 items by Don Mahurin (patches modified somewhat):\n * pidfile patch\n * default mime_types patch\n * NCSA environment environment variables wrapped in\n   #ifdef USE_NCSA_CGI_ENV\n * fix some escaping issues with the directory indexer\n   (Ulf Harnhammar)\n * backport poll support from 0.95\n</pre>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n\n      <tr>\n        <td><b>October 4-5 2002 - Developer's Conference\n        2002!</b></td>\n      </tr>\n\n      <tr>\n        <td>Larry and one of his sons stayed at Jon's house October\n        4-5, 2002.

This should have two effects -\n          a **very** slightly greater latency (if it is measured at\n          all), but a **much** more consistent latency. Finally,\n          Boa now tells clients that it is too busy, although in\n          practical terms, this is not very likely to happen, due\n          to various factors.<br>\n           The ChangeLog entries since 0.94.12rc2 are as follows:\n<pre>\n * try to make NOBLOCK handling in compat.h compatible with Solaris\n * make sure to update current_time before calling signal handlers\n * alter primary loop to make sure that select gets called even\n   when there are requests that are not blocking, and call fdset_update\n   and process_requests (when appropriate) after signal handlers but\n   before select to make sure that blocked requests are still handled\n   by select after a sighup. (Thanks to Karl Olsen)\n * pull select loop into select.c\n * poll server socket once per active connection\n * add send_r_service_unavailable and use it when appropriate\n * state uptime in seconds at normal program termination\n * include sys/fcntl.h if it is found by configure\n</pre>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n\n      <tr>\n        <td><b>17 Feb 2002 - Version 0.94.12rc2 released.</b></td>\n      </tr>\n\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          The updates to 0.94.12rc1 are fairly minor, but do fix\n          one important bug regarding hashing (same bugfix as\n          0.94.11.1). The ChangeLog entries since 0.94.12rc1 are as\n          follows:\n<pre>\n * add some new hash routines, and use djb2 (a variant on a\n   hash alrogithm popularized by Dan J. Bernstein)\n * a side-effect of the new hash routines is a bugfix,\n   involving negative return values from hash routines.\n   This has been fixed.\n * add a routine, show_hash_stats, which is called with other\n   statistical output via sigalarm\n * remove some duplicate prototypes from config.c\n * make simple_itoa take an unsigned int\n</pre>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n\n      <tr>\n        <td>The tarball (115,050 bytes) is <a href=\n        \"boa-0.94.12rc2.tar.gz\">here</a> and the detached signature\n        for the tarball is <a href=\n        \"boa-0.94.12rc2.tar.gz.asc\">here</a>.</td>\n      </tr>\n\n      <tr>\n        <td><b>16 Feb 2002 - Version 0.94.11.1 released.</b></td>\n      </tr>\n\n      <tr>\n        <td>This is a maintainence release of 0.94.11 until 0.94.12\n        is finished.
